✨ **About the Mod** ✨

Have you ever wanted to flip a switch and bring your Minecraft home to life—without feeding your resource hungry electricity generator? With the help of this addon for MrCrayfish's new furniture mod, "Furniture Refurbished", now you can! ⚡

This mod adds a new block called the circuit breaker. This nifty little block is the new heart for your home's electricity system, drawing power straight from your favorite tech mods like Mekanism, Tech Reborn, and Create: Crafts and Additions. No more having to feed your generator coal that could be used to craft your torches and fuel your campfires—just simple, sustainable energy that keeps your lamps glowing and your ceiling fans spinning.
